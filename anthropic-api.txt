model - string - required
The model that will complete your prompt.

As we improve Claude, we develop new versions of it that you can query. This parameter controls which version of Claude answers your request.
Right now we are offering two model families: Claude, and Claude Instant.
You can use them by setting model to "claude-2" or "claude-instant-1", respectively. See models for additional details.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Family ----------- Latest major version --- Latest full version |
| Claude Instant --- claude-instant-1 ------- claude-instant-1.1  |
| Claude ----------- claude-2 --------------- claude-2.0 ---------|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

prompt -- blob -- required
The prompt that you want Claude to complete.

For proper response generation you will need to format your prompt as follows:

JavaScript
----------
const userQuestion = r"Why is the sky blue?";
const prompt = `\n\nHuman: ${userQuestion}\n\nAssistant:`;
See our comments on prompts for more context.


Human: Hello, world!

Assistant:
max_tokens_to_sample -- integer -- required
The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

Note that our models may stop before reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

stop_sequences -- array of strings
Sequences that will cause the model to stop generating completion text.
Our models stop on "\n\nHuman:", and may include additional built-in stop sequences in the future. By providing the stop_sequences parameter,
you may include additional strings that will cause the model to stop generating.


temperature -- number
Amount of randomness injected into the response.
Defaults to 1. Ranges from 0 to 1. Use temp closer to 0 for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to 1 for creative and generative tasks.

top_p -- number
Use nucleus sampling.
In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order
and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by top_p. You should either alter temperature or top_p, but not both.

top_k -- integer
Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.
Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. Learn more technical details here.

metadata -- object
An object describing metadata about the request.
{
    "user_id": 128868969870
}
An external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.
This should be a uuid, hash value, or other opaque identifier.
Anthropic may use this id to help detect abuse. Do not include any identifying information such as name, email address, or phone number.

stream -- boolean
Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

See this guide to SSE events for details.
